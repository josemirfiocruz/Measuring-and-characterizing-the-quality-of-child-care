## Notes for running the codes

i) in the "preparing_base" file there are codes only to prepare the raw base (LCA_covariate) for the model adjustment; the resulting base is saved as "CHC_Covariates";
ii) run the first code of the model via Mplus "Etap1_2_CHC_CovClusViss"; in step 1 we will have a saved file (3BCH_V2) that will be used to adjust the second code (see #3)
iii) run the second code of the model via Mplus "Etapa3_CHC_Covariates".

Obs.: 
"LCA_covariate.dta" : full database
"CHC_Covariates" :  database as entered in Mplus
"3BCH_V2" : Output files from step 1-2, used in step 3
